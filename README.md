## Data Source
Two data sets were sourced from cdc.gov and NYTimes (via Kaggle) to 
illustrate the COVID-19 death rates across states and compare to 
COVID-19 case numbers. This data can also be used to compare 
COVID death rates against flu and pneumonia death rates by state or 
country as a whole.
